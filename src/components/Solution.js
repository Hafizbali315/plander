					it has never been so easy to meet the local population (not even before the low-cost airlines!). We will be the bridge between you
					and the locals who like to cook and meet people from all over the world, through a simple and totally safe mobile application.
					<span>There's no better way to get to know a culture than to walk into their house and sit down at the table with them.</span>
					The Paladar application is a network for sharing meals in the locals private homes â€“ designated in the application by Paladares -
					among those who are willing to be hosts and the travellers who are looking for and authentic experience of tourism, interacting
